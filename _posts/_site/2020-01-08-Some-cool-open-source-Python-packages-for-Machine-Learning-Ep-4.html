<h2 id="online-learning">Online learning</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/creme-ml/creme">creme</a> - a library for online machine learning, also known as incremental learning. Online learning is a machine learning regime where a model learns one observation at a time. This is in contrast to batch learning where all the data is processed in one go. Incremental learning is desirable when the data is too big to fit in memory, or simply when you want to handle streaming data. In addition to many online machine learning algorithms, creme provides utilities for extracting features from a stream of data.</li>
